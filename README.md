The dataset contains 284,807 credit card transactions with 31 columns, including PCA-transformed features (V1 to V28), Time, Amount, and the target variable Class (0 = legitimate, 1 = fraud). It has no missing values and is highly imbalanced, as fraudulent transactions are rare. The goal is to build a fraud detection model to classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent, making it ideal for classification and anomaly detection tasks.
### Project Description: Credit Card Fraud Detection

In this project, a highly imbalanced credit card transaction dataset was analyzed to detect fraudulent transactions. The data was preprocessed using **undersampling** to address the imbalance between legitimate and fraudulent cases. Machine learning models such as **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** were employed to evaluate prediction accuracy. Key insights included identifying features with the highest correlation to fraud and determining the **top 10 most important features** contributing to the classification.
